# About this repo
This is a firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico that runs as the client for this repo: https://github.com/AgentMC/BoilerManager

The code in this repo is compatible with SDK 2.2 and thus is fully independednt version control-wise. In theory.

Per RPi docs it should be enough to have a VSCode with RPi Pico extension, pull this source and then select the right parameters in the extension and it should work.

# About the 1.5 code
The code in the main repo is the one compatible with SDK 1.5. I will not remove it for the time being.
